# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
  The purpose of this project is to assist recent Finance graduate, Steve, by looking into DQ stocks for his parents. He has extracted data from a few green energy stocks in order to possibly diversify their portfolio. We are using VBA to automate tasks in order to supply Steve with code that will be able to be reused with any stock. We will complete this task by refractoring a VBA code to collect specific stock data in the years 2017 and 2018 in order to increase efficiency. We will use this data to determine whether or not it is worth it for Steve's parents to invest.

## Results
  There is a stark difference between the stock performance in 2017 and 2018. 10 of the 12 companies returned less than 1% for the year 2018. By refractoring the script, we were able to increase the overall run time.

- Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script

## Summary
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?
- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
